## Release Notes:

- [09 Feb 2022]

The Ministry of Health COVID-19 data and statistics [webpage](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics) is the official source of vaccination data. 

- [18 Jan 2022]

Since August 2021, the Ministry of Health has been making vaccination data available to third-party developers on AGOL and GITHUB to enable them to receive this information as efficiently as possible.

The Ministry is making some interim changes to our reporting as we start vaccinating 5 to 11-year-olds to protect the privacy of individual children.

In particular, because at this early stage of the 5 to 11-year-old rollout the numbers of children being vaccinated is relatively small, we are not initially providing breakdowns of the data by geographical region or ethnicity.
As a consequence, the usual data will not be available for an interim period beginning on 18 January 2022.
Instead the Ministry will provide CSV files containing detailed vaccination data for the 12+ age group on our website for use by third party developers. These will be updated daily and weekly.

The usual daily and weekly website updates will continue, and we will report separate data for 5 to 11-year-olds, including daily totals and a cumulative total.

Thank you for your understanding during this interim period. We will provide a replacement API incorporating 5 to 11-year-old data once the rollout is further advanced.
